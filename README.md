Assignment 3: Factorial Calculation and Using the Math Module for Calculations

Problem Statement
# Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

Define a function factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using recursion.
Return the calculated factorial and print the result.

Solution:
Calculate Factorial Using a Function
1. Input the number (a):

2. Take an integer input a from the user.

3. Define the factorial function:

4. This function calculates the factorial of the given number a using recursion.

5. If a is less than 2, return 1 as the base case.

6. Otherwise, recursively multiply a by the factorial of a-1.

7. Call the factorial function:

8. Calculate and print the factorial of a.

# Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

Ask the user for a number as input.
Use the math module to:
Calculate the square root of the number.
Calculate the natural logarithm (log base 10) of the number.
Calculate the sine of the number (in radians).
Display the results for each calculation.

Solution :
 Using the Math Module for Calculations
1. Input the number (n):

2. Take an integer input n from the user.

3. Use the math module to calculate:

4. The square root of n using math.sqrt(n).

5. The logarithm (base 10) of n using math.log10(n).

6. The sine of n (in radians) using math.sin(n).

7. Display the results for each calculation:

8. Print the calculated values for the square root, logarithm, and sine.
